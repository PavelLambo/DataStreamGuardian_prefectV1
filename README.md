# DataStreamGuardian_prefectV1
## Overview
DataStreamGuardian_prefectV1 is a project designed to orchestrate and monitor ETL processes using Prefect v1. It emphasizes on maintaining data integrity and automating the CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) process for data pipelines. The core component of this project is CICD_Flow.py, which is responsible for managing and deploying updates to ETL scripts in a controlled and efficient manner.

## Features
### Automated ETL Pipeline Management: Automates the deployment of ETL scripts, ensuring consistency and reliability in data processing.
### Checksum Verification: Ensures the integrity of ETL scripts by verifying checksums before and after deployment.
### Integration with GitLab: Seamlessly fetches updates from a GitLab repository to keep the ETL process up-to-date.
### Error Handling and Notifications: Provides robust error handling and sends notifications in case of process failures or discrepancies.
## Requirements
Python 3.x
Prefect v1
GitLab API access
Additional Python libraries: requests, hashlib, subprocess, os, smtplib, multiprocessing

## Configuration
Before running CICD_Flow.py, ensure you have configured the following:

GitLab API URL and Project ID in the script.
Private Token for GitLab API authentication.
Prefect project name and any necessary Prefect configurations.
Email configuration for notifications (if applicable).
